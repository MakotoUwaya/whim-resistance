## Description

- Can play game "Resistance" on [wh.im](https://wh.im/).
- For the Japanese.
- The Resistance is a social deduction game with secret identities.
- Players are either members of the Resistance attempting to overthrow a malignant government, or Spies trying to thwart the Resistance.
- The Resistance wins the game if three Missions are completed successfully; the Spies win if three Missions fail.
- The Spies can also win if the Resistance is unable to organize the Mission Team at any point in the game (5 failed votes on a single mission).
- A fundamental rule of the game is that players may say anything that they want, at anytime during the game. Discussion, deception, intuition, social interaction and logical deductions are all equally important to winning.
